FOR FETCH:
often you do fetch().then{response => blah1}.then{result => blah2}
But if you add more code to balh1 other than just response.json(), it doesn't know to return the result of response.json().  So you have to add 'return'.  for example


** THIS WORKS ** //because its just a stright up function
fetch(url, requestOptions)
    .then(response => response.text()  )

** THIS WORKS ** //because your new {} function is returning what response.text() returns
fetch(url, requestOptions)
    .then(response => {
        fetchStatus = response.status;
        (((((((return))))))) response.text()
    }).then(...)

** THIS DOES NOT WORK ** //because your new {} function is returning nothing
fetch(url, requestOptions)
    .then(response => {
        fetchStatus = response.status;
        response.text()
    }).then(...)

and by 'work' i mean the second ".then()" has context of what result is
