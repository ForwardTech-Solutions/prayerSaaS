todo now
	- blast a list to an email group


	- create a QR code to accept prayers into a group
        - use this npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qrcode-logo 
        - create a microservice that lets you create QR codes and choose what to link them to and change what they link to
            -   have a dynamo table of key/destination pairs where key is the URL generated for the QR (and the value of the code)
                and the destination is where you are redirected todo
        
        - create static URL pages that can un-authorized accept prayers to a specific destination.  Make this url the destination of ^
            - something like /addPrayerTo/group/:id
                - only load page successfully if :id is valid
                    - create a new endpoint for unvalidated people to submit a groupid to see if its real and accepts unauthorized
            - create a new API endpoint that can unauthorized check if a group accpets unauthorized requests
                - i need to refactor all of prayer to have fields like 
                    - source
                    - prayerGroupID
                    - fullName
                - prayergroups need fields
                    - accepts_unauthorized_requests
            - captcha


todo other 
    - move all API hardcodes to enviroment variables


test to write: 
    - addPrayerTo/groups
        - displays info
        - catches bad words
        - error when group doesn't accept
        - blank name yeilds anonymous
        - successfully adds prayer to valid group unauthorized




bugs: 
    - currentUser gets replaced with [](blank) sometimes
    - email response says "Successful" on any network reply
    - clicking on one list link (on the sidebar) and then a different one does not change the screen, only the URL
    - you can have duplicates prayers in a list and can do so by adding them to a list 



long term:
    - incoroporate testing
    - figure out what the benefit of this platform even is
        - Update: been working on that.  it is a set of tools to empower churches to create active and powerful prayer cultures
