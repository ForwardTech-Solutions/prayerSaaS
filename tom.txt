test to write: 





bugs: 
    - currentUser gets replaced with [](blank) sometimes
    - email response says "Successful" on any network reply
    - clicking on one list link (on the sidebar) and then a different one does not change the screen, only the URL
    - you can have duplicates prayers in a list and can do so by adding them to a list 



long term:
    - incoroporate testing
    - figure out what the benefit of this platform even is
        - Update: been working on that.  it is a set of tools to empower churches to create active and powerful prayer cultures
